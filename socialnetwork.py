#The first step for every social network is getting users and getting as much information as possible that can be exploited or sold to advertisers for large sums of money. Obviously, you want to be rich and famous like Mark Zuckerberg, so you need to do the same.

#Objective

#Create a command-line Python script that asks a user for personal details and gives feedback on those details.

#What you need to master for this assignment:

#Basic math
#Variables and the print function
#The input function and type conversion
#Control flow: the if statement
#Concatenation
#String methods
#The quit function
 #What your program should do:

 #Your program must:

#Print a welcome statement when the program is run.
#Ask for first name of the user and return that with a welcoming message including that name (e.g. ‘Welcome Bob, welcome to my program’)
#Ask for the last name of the user and check if the user’s last name is the same as your last name, and if so, should mention that the user is a family member. Your check should be able to account for people entering a last name with either a first capital letter or all lower case characters.
#Your social network is for people of 18 years or older so it should ask for the birth year of the user and determine if they’re old enough for your social network. If the user is not old enough it should give a warning message or exit the program. It’s okay if this check is not 100% accurate.
#Your code should calculate the estimated value of the user for the advertisers of your social network. How you calculate this value is completely up to you. You can use data points like the age, number of characters in the name, gender, etcetera.
#Ask for two more questions and give appropriate feedback. What you ask in these two questions and what you answer is up to you.
#Print a goodbye statement as the last thing it does
#Your program must also:

#Be properly commented.
#Be executable using the python interpreter from the command line (e.g. ‘python assignment-1.py’)
